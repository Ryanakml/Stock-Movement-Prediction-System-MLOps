2025-09-07 15:21:31,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

# Why Listen to Me

Former OPEN leader. Diamond-handed this stock from $10+ down to 50 cents and back. If you've been holding for weeks, I've been holding for years.

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.  
  
Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care. 

# The Numbers That Matter

**Insider Reality Check:**

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

When the people with the most information are selling, that tells you everything.

**Q3 Earnings Preview:**

* Revenue dropping 50% (Q2: $1.57B → Q3: $800-875M)
* Returning to losses after one barely-profitable quarter
* Debt: $2.5B vs Equity: $0.6B (bankruptcy risk is real)

**Options Market:** Less than 2% chance of hitting $10-12. You might squeeze 10-20% more, but you're more likely to lose 40-50%.

# Why the Bull Cases Are Wrong

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

Speaking of business model challenges, Opendoor carries \~$2.5B in debt vs \~$0.6B in equity. Altman Z-Score of 0.74 puts the company firmly in the distress zone.

This doesn’t mean bankruptcy tomorrow - they have levers and everyone there has been working hard to turn the ship around. But if housing stays soft, bankruptcy is absolutely on the table. Be cautious.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.",44,30,wallstreetbets
2025-09-07 10:17:17,Let's talk about Nuvation Bio (NUVB),"Hello everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on Nuvation Bio ($NUVB) and why I’m so hyped about it. 🚀

Nuvation Bio is an American pharmaceutical company developing treatments for extremely rare diseases. Recently, one of their drugs got approved in the U.S. and China, and Japan’s approval is expected soon.

I invested at the beginning of October, and so far I’m up around +60%. 💸 Last month, they dropped their earnings report and crushed expectations with amazing Q2 results.

Analysts’ price target is around $7.50, and if things keep going this way, I honestly think we might get there sooner than expected.

Not financial advice, just sharing my experience. DYOR! 😉",0,23,wallstreetbets
2025-09-07 06:26:56,Diversifying portfolio away from bank stocks,"When I became an adult, I spent my earliest years of investing putting money into Canadian bank stocks within my registered accounts. This was largely at the advice of my parents, who also have a lot of money in Canadian bank stocks. Since that time, I learned about low cost index investing. I began putting my new contributions into VEQT to obtain broad diversification and thus mitigate the risks inherit with being concentrated in a few stocks or one sector. I’m grateful to my parents for getting me started early with investing. Even if my own investment philosophy now differs from theirs, I’ve certainly benefitted greatly from time in the market. However, I am a bit concerned with the composition of my current portfolio. Half of it is in Canadian bank stocks, the vast majority of which is BNS. BNS recently had excellent earnings, and the big Canadian banks in general are very well capitalized, regulated closely by the government, and have a low risk of failure. The dividends paid by Canadian banks are quite good. However, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m really over concentrated in BNS at this point, even if the stock itself is objectively quite good. I’m a young person with a long investing time horizon. As such, I think an all-equity allocation is best for me. A broadly diversified ETF like VEQT (or VT in my RRSP) would allow me to capture global market returns over the long term in a relatively safe fashion. I don’t plan to sell all of my BNS, but having so much feels risky and like stock picking in a sense. I’m (cautiously) optimistic that BNS will continue to do well, but I don’t have the knowledge or confidence to predict that it will outperform the market or a broadly diversified ETF. Would it be prudent to sell a large portion of my BNS if my long term goal is growth? I would put that money immediately into a low-cost diversified equity ETF. Canadian bank stocks, while solid holdings, seem more focused on stability and dividend payments. I worry I would be leaving market returns on the table by being so over concentrated. ",2,1,investing
2025-09-07 01:57:42,"Market Sentiment: Denial Lifts Stocks, But Risks Remain","Recent rallies suggest a form of “denial sentiment” in markets: investors appear willing to overlook underlying macro risks and instead focus on liquidity and short-term optimism. This kind of environment often boosts risk appetite and pushes equities higher in the short run.

However, key concerns remain:

* Questions around the sustainability of corporate earnings growth.
* Diverging macro data, with some leading indicators pointing to downside risks.
* Uncertainty around the path of interest rates and inflation.

In short, markets are caught between sentiment and fundamentals. Denial and liquidity may continue to drive gains in the near term, but if fundamentals fail to deliver, volatility could return.

This is intended as a macro sentiment observation only, not investment advice.",5,15,investing
