2025-08-30 00:48:05,Nvidia Now vs Apple in 2010-2019,"Apple used to  at the top of marketplace recommendations for years. The run that Apple had between 2010 and 2019 was very strong. It established them as an incumbent within  after the release of arguably the most mature of the early iPhones. Apple experiential growth for years.

What I do not understand is if Nvidia is just a hype machine that will die down. I understand AI powers,  and other services and tools such as bitcoin mining. 

And it seems to me that Nvidia is a business to business offering, and not a business to consumer offering. Nvidia is primarily providing hardware and limited software solutions with the expectation people will build on their platforms. I don’t foresee businesses  continuing to make this investment every three or four years  the way consumers  did the iPhone.

Although Nvidia is strong now doesn’t have a capacity to remain strong? It seems to me that they are selling the shovel and you can only sell so many of those.",0,3,investing
2025-08-29 16:37:07,"Hi, freshly starting investing into stocks. I need advice on the following potential portfolios. I am torn between multiple different versions.","Hello, I am a 21-year-old male investor from Australia using Pearler as my broker platform of choice. My primary goals are:

Long-term wealth accumulation (15-25+ year time horizon).
High growth, prioritizing capital appreciation.

Financial Independence / Retire Early (FIRE), with an ambition to eventually have my portfolio generate enough passive income to cover at least some of my living expenses (e.g., rent or groceries).

2025-08-25 22:46:51,Help on my next more conservative investment move towards retirement,"Eight years ago, I decided to invest one month of my life researching growth and value investing. My reasoning was, with $30,000 I can never throw up or fill with which I am going to retire. Therefore, I’m basically going to be all on black. And not worry about it. I can either do really well or or the complete opposite. And I was OK with losing the whole 30,000 if it came to it. By the time I finished my research, I had settled on a selection of stocks. Fast-forward eight years, and those picks have become a $650,000 portfolio.

Nvdia 60%  I invested 11k originally and it’s around 400k now.  
Tesla 20%

The rest distributed among these
Amazon
Apple
Spyi


Today, I’m 52 years old and believe it’s time to plan for retirement, which I hope will be in about 10 years. I have mostly left these stocks untouched over the years, though I have rebalanced slightly. For the most part, it's the same portfolio.
I don’t think it’s sustainable for me to stay with something this aggressive at my age, but I have no idea where to go from here. My Nvidia stock is up 27x, and everything else has at least doubled. I was offered a managed portfolio with all the bells and whistles (tax strategy, etc.) for an annual fee of 0.89%.
Everything I read back when I did my research advised against my choices, and a lot of advice today would still argue against it. But I can’t deny that if I had listened, my portfolio would probably be one-fifth of what it is today.
Does anyone have any advice on what to do next? My retirement goal is 2035.

2025-08-24 11:37:04,$AAPL toward its new ATH. Wyckoff confirms that,"From a technical perspective, $AAPL is preparing for a new ATH.  
My analysis is based only on technicals, so you won't find anything related to the fundamental of the Company.

[$AAPL 12M Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qd76QvMN/) \- This is the highest timeframe we have access to and we don't need anything else.  
Bias is super bullish since price is trending nicely above the EMAs (5-10-20).

[$AAPL 10W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/q1qZ0bMf/) \- In the 10W chart, we can see price sweeping below the 20 EMA (green one). That is usually a sign that an [Accumulation](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tUSS3XGd/) is taking place. Since we are taking in consideration Wyckoff cycles for this analysis, someone could argue that, currently, we are in a [Re-accumulation 2](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ocRH2uyi/) instead of in a new forming cycle. That could be true because both are valid, it depends on how we decide to see charts. Anyway, price is showing bullishness

[$AAPL 1W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6w2dPABd/) \- In the Weekly chart, the price has just come out of an accumulation and currently it's possible we are about to form the first Re-accumulation. I'm expecting price to form at least another indecision candle (whether it will be an inside candle or a lower candle that hits the 5 or 10 EMA) to confirm a solid re-accumulation. If price manages to break that high (black line) it is very likely that price will reach another ATH in 3-6 months

This is not financial advice, obviously.  
Just want to share with you what I see on the charts

2025-08-08 19:41:21,Opinion: Investing in semiconductors is riskier than most think and many are ignoring the elephant in the room,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how much optimism there is around semiconductor stocks, especially names like TSMC, ASML, Nvidia, etc. The fundamentals look great. AI is booming, chip demand is exploding, margins are strong, and innovation keeps accelerating.

But there's one huge risk that’s consistently downplayed by investors: TSMC’s geographic exposure to Taiwan, and more specifically, the growing possibility of a Chinese invasion.

Most investors seem to consider it highly unlikely. But if you listen to defense experts, geopolitical analysts, and even governments, they see it as a real risk with real probability. This isn’t just noise or fearmongering.

TSMC is one of the most important companies in the global semiconductor supply chain. If conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it won’t just be bad for them. It could disrupt the entire industry. ASML would lose a key customer. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm would all be cut off from advanced chip supply. And yes, TSMC is building fabs in the US and Japan, but those won’t match Taiwan’s capabilities for years.

The bullish projections for the chip sector almost always assume political stability around Taiwan and China. But what if that assumption fails?

I’m not saying semiconductors are a bad investment. They’ve been some of the top performers over the past decade. But I do think many portfolios are overexposed to this single point of geopolitical risk.

We can’t predict macro events. But we can choose how much risk we take. Personally, I try to avoid putting too much weight in the chip sector. I prefer companies that would be less impacted if a worst-case scenario plays out. Sure, the returns might be lower, but so are the potential losses.

Just some thoughts. Curious to hear how others are thinking about this. Is the market underestimating the Taiwan risk?",175,241,investing
2025-08-08 06:05:35,What exactly does Apple “investing $100 billion ($600 total) in America” mean?,"Where does this money come from? What counts as an “investment?” Is any of this binding?

It sounds like a feel-good headline that allows Trump to tout a win, but makes little material difference to Apple’s existing spending. In exchange, Apple gets the tariff exemptions it wants without actually giving up much.

From CNBC:

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/apples-tim-cook-convinced-trump-to-drop-made-in-usa-iphone-for-now.html

“Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn’t break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple’s suppliers are contractually required to keep the information secret. Apple doesn’t report how much its new campuses in Austin or North Carolina end up costing.

Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.

Apple said in February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.

In Apple’s fiscal 2024, Apple spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses, and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.

Teffler said she didn’t think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple’s profitability, especially since it already has existing relationships with the various companies such as Corning.”",921,234,investing
2025-08-08 05:45:37,"""Down 42% in Four Months - Tech Heavy Portfolio Getting Crushed""","I'm posting this partly for accountability and partly hoping someone can relate. My portfolio has gone from $85k to $49k over the past four months, with the worst damage happening in the last two weeks where I lost $18k.

My strategy seemed solid on paper: heavy allocation to established tech giants that I thought were ""too big to fail."" Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, companies with massive cash flows and dominant market positions. I figured even if growth slowed, these would be relatively stable compared to speculative plays.

Boy, was I wrong.

The combination of rising interest rates, AI bubble concerns, and regulatory pressure has absolutely hammered my holdings. What I thought was a conservative approach to growth investing turned into a masterclass in concentration risk.

Here's what's eating at me: roughly $6k of this loss is my actual contributions, while $30k represents gains from earlier this year that have completely evaporated. I went from feeling like a genius in Q1 to questioning everything I thought I knew about investing.

My current dilemma: Do I start rotating into value stocks or defensive sectors? Do I double down on my thesis that these companies will recover? Or do I take the L and move to index funds like I probably should have done from the start?

The hardest part is watching my timeline for financial goals get pushed back by years. I had plans that depended on this portfolio growth, and now I'm basically back to square one.

Apple services is not doing well. Apple TV is burning money. Most of the gen z people I know use Spotify, not Apple Music.

Of course however as time showed, other competitors proved to be better, such as Apple with their innovative tech.

The consumers, it seemed, brought up the devices, earlier than otherwise, to beat the tariffs and price hikes that might come associated with it.  The company said the tariffs cost them about $800 mn and in the upcoming quarter it could be in the range of $1.1 bn (\~40% more).

So, with more tariffs coming in today (assuming atleast some stick longer), it either is going to eat into the company’s margin or more unlikely but passed onto the consumers, there is a good expectation that this will cause sales to go down.  With most customers having already bought the iPhones last quarter to beat the tariffs, the sales from the upcoming quarter have been cannibalized in the previous quarter.  The wearables and ipad sales are already down, even after launching a cheaper ipad.  

There are other macro challenges to the company as well.

2025-07-31 00:04:50,Ran 5-year investment analysis vs $1.2M Bay Area home purchase - Is it better to walk away and keep renting?,"We're considering walking away from a $1.2M townhome purchase in the East Bay and want to validate our thinking before making this final decision.

# Our Financial Situation

* Household income: \~$360k base with annual bonuses (adds 12-18% yearly)
* Down payment ready: $400k
* Current rent: $3k/month for 2br/2ba with rent control protections
* Market rate for similar rentals: $2800 -4,200+ in our area

# The Property Details

The townhome is in Dublin and is in a newer development near good schools, but comes with some high costs:

* Mello Ross: \~$500+ monthly for 25+ years (until around 2050)
* HOA fees: $440/month
* Property taxes: Standard rate but on $1.2M assessment
* Financing: Looking at 6.875% rates in current market or 5.875 for 5 year ARM

# Our Analysis

When we calculated total monthly ownership costs versus our current situation, we would be paying approximately $4,500 MORE per month than we do now. This includes mortgage, taxes, special assessments, HOA, insurance.

Here's where it gets interesting: We ran a 5-year scenario assuming the house appreciates at 7% annually (aggressive but possible in this market). Even with that appreciation, investing our $400k down payment plus the $4,500 monthly difference in index funds would give us nearly $1M in investable assets after 5 years.

This means we could potentially put down 60%+ on a $1.68M house (what this one would cost in 5 years) versus 33% today. So basically, we would move from barely affording the down payment to having enough to buy most of the house outright.

# Why We're Hesitating

The math seems almost too good to be true, which makes us wonder if we're missing something important. The Mello Roos special assessments really hurt the economics - that's $500+ monthly (2% increase every year) that provides no return and continues for decades.

# Our Questions

1. Are we being too conservative by assuming we can consistently invest the monthly difference?
2. Is there a flaw in comparing liquid investments to real estate ownership benefits?
3. Are we underestimating the non-financial benefits of homeownership?
4. Could we be missing tax advantages or other factors that change the calculation?
5. Is the ""priced out forever"" fear legitimate, or does the math actually work in our favor?

We genuinely liked this property and the location, but the numbers made us step back. The special assessments(Mello Roos) alone would cost us \~$180k+ over 25 years - money that could compound significantly if invested instead.

Has anyone else done similar analysis when facing Bay Area purchase decisions? Are we overthinking this, or does the investment approach make sense given current market conditions?

**TL;DR**: Running numbers on $1.2M Bay Area townhome vs continuing to rent + invest. Math suggests waiting 5 years while investing creates much stronger financial position even with home appreciation. Seeking validation or reality check on this analysis.",32,58,investing
2025-07-30 06:16:15,Why Choose S&P 500 Over Nasdaq 100? Convince Me Nasdaq Isn’t the Obvious Best Choice,"Hey,
I’ve been investing solely in the S&P 500 for a while now, and I like its broad exposure to 500 companies across all sorts of sectors. It feels like a safe, steady bet with solid returns (around 10.5% annualized historically). 

But lately, I’ve been eyeing the Nasdaq 100, which seems to crush it with higher yields. The Nasdaq’s tech-heavy focus, with giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, makes it look like the obvious choice for maximizing gains.

I’m wondering if I’m missing out by sticking with the S&P 500’s slower, diversified approach. 

Why should I keep my money in the S&P 500 instead of jumping to the Nasdaq 100 (like QQQ) for that sweet growth? Is the diversification really worth it when tech seems to dominate?

2025-07-24 21:04:15,Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same,"A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows.",95,64,investing

[Apple](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/) is reportedly considering acquiring France-based AI startup [Mistral AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mistralai/), according to Bloomberg. Mistral, valued at €5.8 billion ($6.2 billion), has raised approximately $1.2 billion over seven rounds, with a notable €600 million Series B led by [DST Global](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dstglobal/) and [General Catalyst](https://www.linkedin.com/company/general-catalyst/). The company is also in discussions to secure hundreds of millions in debt, signaling aggressive growth plans. Known for its OCR capabilities and fast chatbot ‘Le Chat’, Mistral is currently the biggest AI player in Europe.This move follows previous reports of Apple exploring acquisition talks with [Perplexity](https://www.linkedin.com/company/perplexity-ai/), the US-based AI startup. While Perplexity's leadership denied any active M&A discussions, the interest signals Apple’s urgency in revamping its AI capabilities.Apple’s AI ecosystem has been under scrutiny, with users expressing dissatisfaction over Siri’s outdated performance. The long-awaited Siri overhaul has now been delayed until 2026, further increasing pressure on the company to innovate externally.Compounding these challenges, Apple recently lost key AI talent—notably [Ruoming Pang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAd5nsBVZFosCv5X6A0U8YaAQGWBUVgA9s), head of foundational models, who joined [Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/) for a multi-million dollar offer, and Tom Gunter, a veteran researcher described as “difficult to replace.” Acquiring Mistral could help fill that gap and reestablish Apple’s footing in the AI race.

2025-07-09 04:35:47,I don't see MAG7 level growth for Apple,"I have a hard time seeing MAG7 level growth for Apple in the mid to long term. Some of my thoughts:

- iPhone is their bread and butter but it seems like sales are plateauing. I mean at some point, doesn't everyone who wants an Iphone have an iPhone. And from there, growth becomes people upgrading and I feel that the incremental improvements will be smaller and smaller (as they have been) and the fraction of people with an iPhone upgrading will reduce. So there is not growth here in my view

- what about vision pro? This is interesting, but the sticker shock is big here. Also, there are more competitors in this space now, including META which has been investing in this tech for some time now, and increasingly Google (see their recent I/O). I don't think the vision pro has the cool factor to offset the cost delta between it and others.

- apple car, was this a thing? I think they bailed on this.

I ultimately think that the pixel will eat up some iPhone customers as the AI features (again, see the Google I/O, it's early stage but it will only get better) will be hard to resist for a lot of consumers in my opinionas the tech matures. Even if apple teams with open AI, pixel phones will be more and more build around AI. Apple management have been clear that they see AI more adding ""nuanced"" features in their products, though it's not clear they have a path yet even to this.

2025-06-18 06:46:26,"Apple is resilient, but stock buybacks are diverting capital from its moat","As a longtime Apple customer, I deeply understand its value proposition. However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk. Management would be wise at this point to focus less on stock buybacks and more on effectively investing cash flow into more aggressive M&A and better R&D talent. I predict Apple stock will return 10% annually over the next 12 months. I also predict Apple will return 10% annually over the next 10 years as well.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

2025-06-13 18:25:40,S&P 500 premium is mostly warranted says BofA,"Bank of America analysts argued in a note Friday that the S&P 500’s valuation premium is “mostly warranted,” despite the index appearing expensive by traditional measures.

“The S&P 500 now trades at 21x forward earnings, 35% above average,” BofA wrote, adding that it “looks statistically expensive relative to its own history on all 20 of the valuation metrics we track.”

However, the analysts say comparisons to historical averages may be misleading.

“Today’s S&P is apples vs. prior decades’ oranges,” they said, noting a shift in sector composition.

“Nearly 70% of the index was asset-intensive Manufacturing sectors in 1980 vs. <20% today.”

They argue the index “has become higher quality, with lower leverage, lower earnings volatility, and higher margins.”

BofA also defended the U.S. market’s premium over global peers. “The US trades as the most expensive region (\~40% premium vs. Europe/Asia which trade at 16x),” they noted, but emphasized that “quality, balance sheets, growth potential and risk are statistically superior.”

They pointed to the U.S. being “half as levered as other regions” and praised “significantly lower estimate dispersion on 2025/2026 forecasts.”

Additionally, the U.S. offers “roughly double the long-term growth potential of Asia and Europe, with lower earnings volatility than Europe, plus higher free cash flow per share and a lower percentage of non-earners vs. both Asia and Europe,” says the bank.

BofA also cited structural advantages including “labor fungibility, USD as reserve currency, energy independence, unparalleled liquidity and Tech primacy (at least for now).”

GOOGL, MSFT, NEE, META, BGM, and FCX may benefit from the S&P 500’s sector shift toward higher-quality, capital-light companies, especially in tech, renewables, and metals.

For near-term positioning, BofA’s tactical model prefers U.S. “Communication Services, Utilities and Tech,” and highlights “Interactive Media & Services, Metals & Mining and Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers” as top industry opportunities.",147,88,investing

We a toolmaker Cook said, adding that Apple relationship with Hollywood existed long before TV+ launched.

I don see it as selling more iPhones I see it as a business

Compared to Netflix or MaxPrime TV+ doesn't have a lot of content

But it interesting to see how Apple handles it

A tight catalogue of fame

Brad Pitt Scorsese Ridley Scott and more

Theatrical premieres of strategic F1 films with Warner Bros and Killers of the Flower Moon with Paramount

No adverts no junk filler

Feels less like Netflix and more like modern HBO but subsidised by iPhone profits

Is this just Apple buying brand equity in Hollywood for the long haul?

Or will this quietly become the next service breakthrough in 5 years?

Do you think Apple TV+ will be profitable on its own?

Is Cook playing 4D chess or is this just another expensive hobby?

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025. We reaffirm our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025,"" said Wei on the earnings call.",122,11,stocks

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market

GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.

AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.

2025-06-06 20:16:03,WWDC 2025 is next week  Can Apple finally deliver something real in AI?,"Apple’s big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* — especially with the AI hype still going strong.

Last year, Apple teased us with “Apple Intelligence,” their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn’t GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.

So what should we expect this year?

Here’s a quick rundown:

 iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro’s visionOS. Mark Gurman says it’s the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.

 AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don’t expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.

 Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.

 New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.

Also, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple’s been struggling for a few quarters now.

Bottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",31,15,stocks

The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[ a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html) in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the [company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) — formed what would come to be known as the [""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[ three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports “right up to 50 percent” as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",119,29,stocks

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-President Trump has threatened AAPL with a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., pressuring the company to shift production domestically. This announcement led to a 3.5% drop in Apple's stock and a broader market sell-off (followed shortly by his comments on Europe). Interested in a short if we break $193 at the open, otherwise more interested in the broad market ETFs. An iPhone made in the US is economically infeasible.

2025-05-23 01:58:33,GENIUS stablecoin and potential push for tokenization,"/\* posted in /stocks but was removed due to off-topic...

It is entertaining to read X recently. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to cut interest rates, in hope that the rate cut will push economic growth and reduce treasury yield. We have a lot of users calling for Fed to increase interest rate, so it makes USD more appealing and reduces treasury yield. Regardless, treasury yield keeps going up. The same story of basis trade and carry trade is playing again today.

It is debatable whether we want a stronger dollar or a weak dollar, but reducing treasury yield seems to be the common goal. How could we easily create more demands for U.S. treasury bonds, when both sides of the aisle embraces the deficit expansion to the core? Well, we can force people into buying treasury bonds, we can wage a war to scare people, or we can create some phantom demands. This is where the GENIUS act may come handy.

The grand scheme is to bring assets on-chain, which requires the players to escrow real-world-assets (RWAs) and issue tokens backed with it. Geez, this sounds like mortgage backed securities and ETF already. To trade those assets, we need currencies, mostly the stablecoins. The GENIUS Act requires holding of USD or treasury bonds, which the issuers will gladly support. Let us imagine that we move NYSE and NASDAQ on-chain and create a copy of all stocks, we suddenly create demand for USD, treasury, and stocks from some users that can't access the U.S. market. Even our dear general Kim can tornado his stash and buy Apple at that time.

Wait! This already happened! Kraken tokenized AAPL, NVDA and TSLA today. Many other crypto firms have worked on RWA for years, including stocks, game skins, etc. GAINS even created a 100x leveraged stock trading platform until they halted it due to heavy admin burden to monitor stock earning, dividends, splits, acquisitions, etc.

So we are likely to see a concerted effort to push assets on-chain in the coming months or years, which will benefit stocks like COIN, HOOD, XYZ, PYPL, and other players, and cryptos such as LINK. Electronic stablecoin payments for daily life is another direction, and I wonder how that will affect V and MA. The damage to both may take years though.

Too bad I didn't scoop HOOD at low, but I bought all above anyway.",0,1,investing

Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the ""AI Consumer Hardware War"" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.

Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more ""economical"" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.

In the most completely politically agnostic way, their DEI stance really hurt the brand and store traffic. They had previously faced issues from store thefts, bloated inventories and declining sales as shoppers switched to more cost friendly retailers. And this was all before tariffs took center stage. 


Now Target has cut their 2025 forecast as revenue decreases and in store shopping drops. Adjusted earnings also came in notably lower. Target CEO avoided saying whether prices would increase because of tariff pressures, but the headwinds continue to mount. 


A few brighter spots are growing digital sales and increased same day delivery. Both full year revenue and earnings have been adjusted down and Target has created a new initiative to address the challenges. But overall the macro environment and company specific challenges have beaten down Target badly.

2025-05-21 00:29:37,Anyone else making these robotics bets?,"In 2000 it was the internet, in the late 2000s we had the online shopping phase, 2010s FAANG stocks grew fast relative to the market, and in the past few years we have seen an AI boom, and a more recent quantum computing and space interest. I predict the next trend will be robotics. It is highly linked to AI, but hasn't seen any attention. As AI grows, robots will be implemented more into our daily lives, a process which will require robotics & robotic parts. Furthermore, these sectors can also have military applications, which will increase the eventual demand, and provides potential for further growth.

Here are my speculative robotics stock picks, which have upside potential if the industry takes off. I included two volatile penny stocks and two stabler bets. I also included parts to show how much of each I would recommend in proportion to a total robotics portfolio, I will probably just invest $1000-$2000, with the specified allocations (maybe heavier on draganfly because I believe their company has a lot of upside potential and I have a high risk tolerance):

Draganfly inc (2 parts): Canadian based, which means that if retaliatory tariffs are implemented they could still trade worldwide. They create drones & other software, for a variety of purposes: agriculture, military, energy, and public 'safety' (potentially surveillance). I predict robotics adoption in all these fields, which would bring success of the company. They have a decent board of directors, rated a strong buy by two analysts, and a low sh0rt interest, which hints a likely upside, and reduces potential of the company being driven to the ground that way. (Ticker: DPRO | $1.77 USD | 18.76M market cap.)

Irobot corp (1 part): US based, make primarily robot vacuum cleaners. They have great revenue (about 6x market cap), so if they could manage a profit their share would do incredibly well. Their share is near 52 week lows. If they diversify into other robotics sectors, they could grow tremendously. I would place a conservative bet into this company, as them diversifying into other sectors would be a big if. (Ticker: IRBT | $2.79 USD | 86.78M market cap)

Teradyne INC (3 parts): They make robots for various industries, including military and industrial. Tech could be used for civilian applications. (Ticker: TER | $81.27 USD | 13.04B market cap)

Rockwell automation (4 parts): They have 27 000 employees, and are already a large player in the robotics industry, yet they still have lots of room to grow. Established, profitable company with P/E ratio comparable to apple, and a dividend of about 1 percent. The reason NVIDIA stock grew is largely their AI hardware, and Rockwell does a lot of robotics hardware. (Ticker: ROK | $307.85 USD | $34.70B market cap)",6,82,investing

(Bloomberg) — Chinese shipments of Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) iPhone and other mobile devices to the US dived to their lowest levels since 2011 in April, underscoring how the threat of US tariffs choked off the flow of big-ticket goods between the world’s two largest economies.

Smartphone exports slid 72% to just under $700 million last month, sharply outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the US, detailed customs data showed on Tuesday. That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.

Investors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.

Last year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.

The value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.

Apple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",462,66,stocks

Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.

The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs.

Furthermore, is 100% stock portfolios worth the risk?","I left a comment elsewhere which after posting it made me curious about making it a post. Forgive me if I spell something incorrectly, English is not my first language.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4590406

So I read this paper about 100% Stock portfolios after watching a YouTube video on it (multiple out there).

And I wondered how I’d go about choosing the stocks I’d invest in. I did so because just last year I didn’t touch stocks but when I went on my app on my iPhone (Stocks) and saw how much I could have made had I just invested in stocks that were already a big presence in almost all of my ETFs the. I’d have more value to my name.

To look at it I viewed an era that had large fluctuations in which I invested in which lead me to 2019 to 2024 because in-between that we had the fed-induced boom and the crash that came before that along with other crazy fluctuations.

So for my example I used march 2019 to March 2024 (which had steep decreases and increases):

1.MSFT: 250.92% 
2.Apple: 248%
3.Meta: 176.44%
4.Googl: 149%
5.Amazon: 96.46%

1.QQQ: 140.45%
2.VTI: 84.34%
3.VOO: 81.39%
4.VT: 54.38%

Here is the Summary of percentages those sticks hold for each ETF:

1. QQQ: ~41.3%
2. VOO: ~22.2%
3. VTI: ~13.0%
4. VT: ~6.1%


It’s not like investing in Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon is unheard of, they already make a huge part of all ETFs you come across that measure commonly used domestic indexes. So… is this the way? I truly want your critique on this because if it works it works and if not then it doesn’t, it’s not about proving I’m right it’s about maximizing my understanding of investing. 



Edit: I think people misunderstood and I didn’t articulate it well either. IM NOT PREACHING FOR 100% stocks but I want your opinions on it! I want to see if maybe it IS the way. I want to grow my knowledge on the topic.

Interesting to see a direct response after hearing the soundbite from the trial from Apple's head of services.

""We continue to see overall query growth in Search. That includes an increase in total queries coming from Apple’s devices and platforms. More generally, as we enhance Search with new features, people are seeing that Google Search is more useful for more of their queries — and they’re accessing it for new things and in new ways, whether from browsers or the Google app, using their voice or Google Lens. We’re excited to continue this innovation and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O.""

> Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, gave an ominous warning today that the iPhone could go the way of the iPod 10 years from now. And the reason, as one might guess, is artificial intelligence.

> That may seem like a silly thing for Apple to say, given that more than half of its revenue is iPhone sales. But Cue calls AI a “huge technological shift,” and suggests that such shifts can humble companies that once seemed unassailable. “When I got to Silicon Valley,” he said, “all the best companies or the most successful companies” — he mentioned HP, Sun Microsystems, and Intel — “either don’t exist today or are significantly smaller and much less impactful.”",573,191,stocks

2025-05-06 22:25:23,Are we sleeping on the impact of the new EU tariffs on tech stocks?,"I’ve been digging into the recent EU tariffs on U.S. tech imports announced last month (March 2025), and I’m wondering if the market is underreacting. The tariffs target hardware and software from big players like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, with rates as high as 15% on some components. The EU’s pushing it as a move to bolster local tech, but it feels like a direct shot at U.S. dominance.I know the narrative is that these companies are “too big to fail” and have global supply chains to cushion the blow, but hear me out:

* Higher costs could squeeze margins, especially for hardware-heavy firms like Apple.
* If the EU doubles down (like they did with GDPR), could we see a broader tech trade war? China’s already hinted at “reciprocal measures.”
* Smaller tech ETFs (thinking XSD or SOXX) might take a bigger hit than the FAANG-heavy ones.

Yet, I’m seeing barely any chatter about this. Are we all too focused on AI hype or the Fed’s rate cuts to notice? Or is this just a blip that’ll fizzle out? Curious what you all think—am I overthinking this, or is there a real risk to tech portfolios here?P.S. I’m long on QQQ but starting to question if I should hedge with some puts.

Given the consumer hasn't yet felt the pinch of tariffs working their way through the system cost-wise, nor have businesses and consumers fully felt whatever shock may (or may not) come from supply chain disruptions, I can't help but wonder if today's market has priced all of that risk in given the rapid rebound.

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

2025-05-02 03:33:23,Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints,"Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  

Here’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: 

* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG 

* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG 

* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  

* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount 

The company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. 

Apple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. 

Analysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. 

Cook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  

“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” 

Cook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  

“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  

Apple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. 

“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  

The company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  

Apple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  

Cook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter. 

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  

However, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  

“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.”

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

2025-04-19 22:25:48,The era of American stock market exceptionalism is over,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first

Nearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.
Over the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.

While it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.
Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.
One of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.

Since 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.

Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”
However, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.

The upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.

All of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.
In fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.
Markets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.
Mr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.
“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”

2025-04-19 13:17:49,This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?,"I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.
Fundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or ""still a bull market"" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)

Some concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. 

So yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming ""anti USA"" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.

This is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. 

Here's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.



There's a school of thought that says ""markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable"" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will ""always"" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.
Another consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now. ",247,284,stocks

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

2025-04-14 02:13:52,What should we expect from the markets on Monday after Trump suspended tariffs on smartphones and laptops?,"On Friday, the Trump administration announced a temporary suspension of tariffs on several key electronic products, including smartphones, laptops, memory chips, and other consumer tech items. These products were initially subject to tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, in addition to a general 10% global tariff.

The official reason cited was to avoid passing excessive costs onto U.S. consumers and to reduce pressure on major American tech firms—particularly those heavily reliant on Asian manufacturing, like Apple and Nvidia.

While markets reacted positively late on Friday, with a modest rebound in tech stocks, the bigger question is: what happens next?
	•	Could this lead to a broader tech-led recovery in the coming days?
	•	Or will uncertainty around future sector-specific tariffs (as hinted by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick) limit any upside?
	•	What are the likely short-term impacts on supply chains and investor sentiment?

Some sectors to watch might include semiconductors, consumer electronics, and companies with significant China exposure.

President Donald Trump’s administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock while benefiting electronics giants including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump’s 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries.

The exclusions would apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years.

The products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers.

The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China.

One such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. Trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

2025-04-10 02:17:30,"🎭 ""Tariff Theater"": Why the 7% Rally Is a Mirage, Not a Market Rebound","The recent 7% rally in equities, coinciding with the Trump administration’s decision to roll back certain tariffs to 10%, has been interpreted by some as the beginning of a broader policy shift. In reality, the fundamental landscape remains unchanged. If anything, the superficial nature of the rollback only highlights the extent to which markets have latched onto optics in the absence of substantive improvement. This rally in equities has not been mirrored by the bond market.

The core dynamics of U.S. trade remain adversarial. China, the United States' largest goods supplier, continues to face high and sustained tariff exposure. The aggregate effective rate, factoring in prior rounds of reciprocal escalation, remains above 100% in several key categories. The European Union has not softened its stance, and in many areas, has reinforced its commitment to retaliatory measures. These are not temporary frictions; they are structural conflicts driven by divergent regulatory philosophies and increasingly protectionist trade regimes.

The administration’s trade team has pointed to limited agreements with smaller economies as signs of progress. But these are largely symbolic, wins on paper that have little bearing on global supply chains or multinational corporate strategy. For firms with cross-border exposure, especially in manufacturing, technology, and retail, the operating environment remains materially constrained. Cost structures have not normalized, logistics remain fragile, and geopolitical uncertainty continues to inhibit capital deployment.

Multinational firms, Apple being a key example, have not seen operational relief. Their upstream suppliers are still entangled in the broader tariff gridlock, and downstream demand remains vulnerable to price transmission effects. Margins are thinning, and strategic flexibility is diminishing as firms are forced to hedge against policy volatility rather than invest into expansion.

Beneath the surface, core macroeconomic indicators point to a deteriorating environment. Unemployment, while still moderate by historical standards, is trending upward. Real wage growth has stalled. Inflation, particularly in services and shelter, remains persistently elevated, even as headline CPI shows deceleration. Consumer credit delinquencies are rising. These are not the foundations of a sustainable recovery.

The current rally in equities is not being underwritten by earnings strength. On the contrary, forward guidance across several sectors has been revised downward, and earnings compression is visible in both nominal and real terms. What we are seeing in markets is not confidence, it is positioning. With liquidity abundant and volatility elevated, capital is rotating into risk on technicals, not fundamentals.

To complicate matters further, market behavior is beginning to resemble that of the late 1980s. Volatility is no longer episodic, it is persistent. The Federal Reserve’s posture remains hawkish, and the long end of the yield curve continues to rise, undermining equity valuations and tightening financial conditions in the real economy. At the same time, geopolitical dislocation is contributing to a growing perception that U.S. assets, once the global default for safe and productive capital, are no longer as insulated as they once were.

Foreign capital inflows are beginning to waver, and the strength of the dollar, long a source of stability, is now a headwind for export competitiveness. In this context, the idea that a marginal tariff adjustment constitutes a policy breakthrough is difficult to justify. If anything, it highlights how thin the narrative support for this rally truly is.

Until there is a credible de-escalation of trade tensions with China and the EU, a normalization of inflation and labor market conditions, and a return to earnings-led equity performance, the market remains structurally fragile. The recent rally is not a signal of recovery. It is a speculative drift, driven by hope, not data.

Investors would do well to treat it accordingly.",371,124,investing

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-China retaliates with an 84% tariff on US goods. The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.

[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&p=d)\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump’s tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the ""we are in danger"" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). 

[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d)\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70–$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures—tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. 

[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&p=d)\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.

There are many reasons to sell now, because odds of us approaching into a bear market is immensely high. People say, “buy more”. Yes, of course. But some people do not have cash on hand. Only when they sell, would they get the necessary liquidity buy at the market’s lows.

A simple strategy can be, liquidate most of your stocks, set a time horizon of when you think the bear market will end (6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc.), then DCA back into the stock market based on this horizon.

Not all selling is “panic selling”. There are definitely very valid reasons to sell your positions right now.",76,113,investing

2025-04-07 08:31:34,"A $2,300 Apple iPhone? Trump tariffs could make that happen.","April 3 (Reuters) - Your favorite iPhone could soon become much pricier, thanks to tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a series of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world that could drastically alter the landscape of global trade, and consumer goods like iPhones could be among the hardest hit, analysts said on Thursday, with increases of 30% to 40% if the company were to pass on the cost to consumers.

Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.

Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.

Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year; its biggest markets include the United States, China and Europe.

The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% - if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers.

A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.

Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, just now gave George Stephanopoulos an example illustrating how tariffs could benefit consumers:

Kevin’s example:

• A small business (SMB) sells 100 apples at $1 per apple.

• Then, a 10% tariff is introduced.

• If the supplier raises prices, consumers purchase 10% fewer apples.

• Kevin explained, “So what is the small business going to do with these 10 apples? They don’t want to eat them, so they’ll lower the price.”

Implication:

The Trump administration expects the real burden of tariffs to fall on the small businesses themselves.

Unspoken consequence:

What Kevin Hassett did not mention is that the small business may go bankrupt, resulting in all of its employees being laid off.

**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. ""Reciprocal"" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**

News: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. 

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

Also currently just a ""watch"", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",212,62,stocks

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.

[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the ""worst housing market in almost 50 years."" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to ""Liberation Day"" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan.

2025-04-03 16:55:59,Can someone explain this for me?,"According to the internet and people that commented in my prior post, the market capitalisation of a company stays the same after buy back of shares i.e, the share price rises sharply to match the increase in EPS.

If that is the case, then it seems like a free way to earn money. Let’s say apple is buying back half of its outstanding shares with its free reserve. I have 100 shares of AAPL which I bought yesterday for 100 dollars totally(1$ per share). I sell 50 of those 100 shares and get 50$ as compensation and hold the remaining 50 shares.

Now, since there are only half the outstanding shares as before the EPS doubles. Since it has doubled, the price doubles too to match the PE ratio as before(Assuming the forecast of the company future cashflows with or without the free reserve stays the same). In such case, my remaining 50 shares are now worth 100$. Upon selling I finally have 150$ in my account.

(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. slid as much as 5.6% in late trading after President Donald Trump announced tariffs that target its overseas production hubs, potentially making the iPhone maker more vulnerable to the levies than anticipated.

The tariffs, announced during a White House event, would reach 34% for China, the administration said Wednesday. Vietnam and India — two other manufacturing centers for Apple — would be 46% and 26%, respectively.

The announcement jolted investors, who have grown increasingly concerned that tariffs will hurt Apple’s bottom line. Though the company has begun to diversify its production away from China, the wide-ranging tariffs are poised to affect the very places it has shifted toward.

2025-03-26 05:14:10,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-21 20:00:31,Critique my portfolios - will I be ok?,"Hi everyone, I didn’t take retirement seriously but life has changed my perspective on a lot of things recently. I’m looking for some advice/ opinions, much appreciated in advance!

Years until full retirement: 37
I’ve started to contribute ~$250 a month into IRA and 6% of salary (~75k) with match into 401k. 401k has about 17k. So as of now Im putting in about 1k/month with the match and In not sure it’s enough.

My questions are: 

1) In roughly 37 years and a conservative outlook, will I be able to live comfortably? I know there are a bunch of factors like location, future inflation, etc but just curious. Thinking of withdrawing 60-70k a year. Honestly I’m not even factoring SSI because I doubt it’ll be a thing by then. 

2) Are these portfolios good for now? I know theres some overlap in the Roth,  especially Apple but thats a personal preference.

2025-03-21 07:54:15,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-21 01:12:22,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",1327,219,wallstreetbets
2025-03-20 13:08:52,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",0,10,stocks

2025-03-20 01:46:11,Apple's 'Siri-Ous' Problem - Here's Why I'm Bearish on AAPL,"Okay, Apple fans (or Cook loyalists), let me finish before you go on a rampage. I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

Boeing is a bust.  
  
US auto makers are falling behind to China.

Apple has completely lost their vision, and it's not clear what the market is missing in mobile computing or wearables. They do have some promising AI chips that could get them ahead for on-device AI tools, but that won't amount to GDP growth as much as preventing loss or re-allocating from another mobile device company (even if more people buy iphones, it doesn't mean more people are buying phones overall).

2025-03-12 00:12:13,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-03 22:52:45,"Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.","WASHINGTON—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.

TSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.

Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.

[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.

“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.

U.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.

Trump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.

“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.

Since taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).

2025-02-24 00:46:53,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

2025-02-16 08:44:38,Original Research: When Does Apple Become a Buy? Or “How Makeup  Really Can Make You the Prettiest Girl in the Room”,"Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.

At 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.

Much like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.

The market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.

# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.

In North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.

Apple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.

That’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.

Apple is winning some battles, but at what cost?

* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.
* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.
* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.
* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.

The big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.

# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.

Apple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.

But Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.

* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.
* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.
* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.

The App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.

Investors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.

# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.

Apple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.

* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.
* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.
* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.

Meanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.

# When Does Apple Become a Buy?

Apple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:

* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.
* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.
* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.

Apple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’m new to equity analysis and have put together the above deep dive on Apple’s valuation, particularly its challenges in emerging markets and risks to services growth. Please let me know what you think about Apple's share price and future.

I work on these memos for my own personal investments. I hold Apple indirectly through VGT.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Apple is a weaker equity than people might think —Apple’s future growth relies on price-sensitive markets where it lacks its usual pricing power, while services, its high-margin growth driver, faces regulatory threats.

2025-02-13 05:16:15,Warren Buffett’s $325 Billion Question,"Warren Buffett currently holds a massive cash reserve, totaling around $325 billion, which represents approximately 30% of Berkshire Hathaway’s assets. But why?

Some believe he is anticipating a market crash, although historically, timming the market has never been his investment strategy. Others argue that the market is overvalued, but even in such conditions, experienced investors can still find good opportunities (Berkshire bought Apple in 2016, when everyone thought it was overvalued, and ended up giving extraordinary returns).

In my opinion, Buffett may be preparing the company for a long-term strategic move: ensuring that Berkshire has enough capital to buy back its own shares after his passing.

It is well known that Warren Buffett does not believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). He and other *value investing* advocates have demonstrated in practice that markets can be irrational in the short term, creating opportunities for those who are patient and disciplined.

2025-02-13 01:49:43,"Apple Interested In Making Humanoid Robot, Top Analyst Says","Source: Investor Business Daily reporting on Twitter post.

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

""However, many projects never progress beyond POC — the Apple Car is probably the most notable example of a project that got stuck at this stage,"" Kuo said.",28,36,stocks
2025-02-12 05:20:13,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",3346,601,stocks

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Nasdaq and Trading Economics reports 1.64, while Yahoo Finance and my personal calculations get 0.97. 

To get 0.97, I subtract the 10-K annual earnings from the sum of quarters 1-3. Then I divide by the weighted average of the diluted shares outstanding reported in the 10-K.

Does anyone know what could cause this discrepancy? Perhaps 1.64 is using non-gaap earnings? Or a different time period considered for earnings?

2025-01-31 23:46:00,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",988,139,stocks

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

2025-01-31 04:36:03,"Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales","Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. 

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. 

Earnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated 

Revenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated 

 iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

2025-01-28 04:16:38,"Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history","Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.

The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

The selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. 

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”

The analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”

But after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.

Data center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.

For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.

Nvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.

CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.

The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.

“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.

Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

2025-01-27 02:47:36,S&P500 vs individual stocks,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

I’ve never been one to buy into the AI hype but Apple’s implementation simply can’t work with their commitment to privacy. From a tech perspective, I believe the looser the restrictions in the name of privacy, the better the results. Which is why Siri has always sucked. 

There’s only so much you can do with on-device models. Developing a pattern based on your data will help. It also helps advertisers. Again, in my opinion why Google is better at AI. 

AAPL will have to just fall back on hardware and unless they unveil a folding iPhone next year, I have a bad feeling about their stock price.",14,64,investing

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",919,462,stocks

I planned to open a joint brokerage and Roth IRA account with Fidelity, and open a HYSA on Wealthfront, but then found out about Fidelity's CMA accounts and cannot decide which option to go with.

Wealthfronts UI is super appealing compared to Fidelity. I'm a new investor and Fidelity intimidates me a little bit. But since these will be set-it and forget-it accounts, I don't know how much weight I want to put into that since I don't plan on regularly using them. I am an Apple Card user and just found out about Apple's HYSA and think the UI point applies here as well.

I like the idea of using Fidelity so everything is simple and in one place. I've read about putting the money into FDLXX instead of SPAXX since it's state/local tax-exempt. Overall, the CMA seems like a really good option compared to a HYSA, I just don't understand it as much at the moment.

I'm not keen on rate chasing. I want simplicity and to automate/set and forget my investing/ savings. Right now I am with Chase and will probably keep my checking with them for the convenience of having a local branch (not opposed to using Fidelity or Weatlhfront for my checking account).

But my rationale says that even if these economies grow, it's the companies from the developed world that will benefit the most. For example, as poor countries gain more disposable incomes, they'll be able to buy more expensive products like iPhones and MacBooks. So this will help the Apple stock grow not the stock of some company in these emerging economies. That's not to say those companies won't grow at all, sure they will with increased internal demand, but the developed world has more to gain from the growth of the emerging economies. Also, most internal growth will come from international companies opening their manufacturing plants in emerging economies like Apple and Samsung manufacturing in India.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

2024-12-05 16:57:01,TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

Is a new 'super product cycle' on the horizon?","**As 2025 approaches, the countdown is on for the release of a number of new Apple products. According to reports, Apple will bring a series of anticipated new products in the spring of 2025, covering a number of popular product lines such as the iPhone SE, iPad and MacBook Air. Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

2024-11-04 22:06:26,Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

2024-11-03 01:20:38,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

2024-11-01 06:19:07,Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ,"Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:

## Apple's Recent Performance

Apple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.

## Potential for Further Trimming

With Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].

## Broader Market Considerations

Berkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.

## Investor Takeaway

While Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:

1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition
2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings
3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire
4. Overall market and economic uncertainties

Given that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.

2024-10-30 03:47:24,Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",361,177,stocks

1. **CROX** \- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.
2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.

**tldr:  PYPL go down, CROX go up**

**bonus plays:** I'm shorting both **CDNS** (Cadence Design Systems), and **AMKR** (Amkor Technology). Smaller position.

2024-10-09 16:32:24,TSMC's revenue for September surged 39.6% YoY,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) revenue for September surged 39.6% year-over-year to about NT$251.87B amid growing demand for artificial intelligence chips for use in AI products.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

Month-over-month TSM's revenue rose 0.4% as it had generated NT$250.87B in revenue in August.

TSM is slated to report its third quarter results on Oct. 17.",95,26,stocks
2024-10-08 05:50:46,Do you get the urge to gamble (with stocks) and how you deal with it. ,"So in a few accounts I have accumulated 100k+ over the years with the usual advise of S&P 500 index funds - set it and forget. But every few months I get the urge to sell a part of it and gamble in individual stocks. I did that with Tesla in 2018 (yes it was kind of a gamble then) and that paid off, a few others paid off too but then some didn’t pay off. Overall, am I beating the market? - I am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that don’t keep track of previous account gains. But I am not loosing either with the strategy. How do you keep this urge/itch away? Just keeping it in S&P 500 is so boring. 

EDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year. It’s fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100%. The high from stocks which is 1k-10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don’t bet on penny stocks. These are mostly blue chip like when APPLE or AMAZON or CHIPOTLE does down, I would buy it and then sell in 1-6 months or just sit on it until it goes up. Sometimes stocks like NEO never go up. I also only SELL options. ",88,112,investing

2024-10-02 02:15:40,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

My examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",37,35,stocks
2024-10-01 22:23:05,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await major Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/15/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-await-major-fed-decision-live-updates.html)
*****
> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
> “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.”

2024-09-10 15:14:19,Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland ,"Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

2024-09-09 04:02:32,The AAPL Monday Morning arbitrage trade (codename 7senshino's arbitrage),"Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

2024-09-04 20:00:41,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-09-03 04:33:02,Implications of Buffett selling Apple,"I have been thinking a lot lately about Buffett selling half of his Apple stake, in part to pay taxes on it now, instead of in the future. Buffett has referred to Apple as a ""crown jewel"" in the Berkshire portfolio in the past, so I was really caught off-guard by the sell. Then this past week I read ""The Retirement Time Bomb Ticks Louder"" by Ed Slott, and it only reinforced what I was already thinking. 

Higher tax rates are coming, and sooner or later the government is going to target 401k's and IRA's. The old adage of ""tax deferred when you are working so you can withdraw it and be taxed at a lower rate later"" is likely not true. We are, right now, likely in the lowest tax bracket we will ever be. 

Therefore, is anyone else thinking like Buffett? Anyone taking capital gains now, even without offsetting losses? Anyone converting 401k to Roth IRA? I am really starting to consider it.",0,32,investing
